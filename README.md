<h2 align="center"><em>I enjoy working as a Data Engineering Consultant in the cloud, building Analytics workflows and discovering valuable insights that help solve problems for client businesses and other types of organizations.</em></h2>

<p>I have a keen interest in ETL and ELT data Pipelines, Machine Learning Systems, Analytics Engineering and Data Warehousing, as well as Cloud Development Operations. I am on a career path that leads to becoming a seasoned Data and Analytics Engineer with useful Machine Learning Operations(MLOps) Engineering, and Cloud computing skills.
</p>

<p>
With an Educational Background in Engineering Technology and Applied Sciences, I have acquired a broad and rich skillset that overlaps the fields of Data and Machine Learning Engineering, Software Development, and Cloud Operations. I have worked on more than a few Engineering and Cloud projects, both individually and as part of Agile Development teams. My experience covers building data products in Retail, Energy, Telco, Banking and Financial services, and also HR Analytics.
</p>

<p>I enjoy working with data, discovering valuable insights that help solve problems for businesses and other types of organizations.</p>

<p>I also love programming and am enhancing my skills in Python and and SQL, database design, data warehouse modelling, as well as Machine Learning model development, experimentation, packaging and deployment. I also have marginal exposure to JavaScript, Microsoft C#(.NET Core), and a tiny bit of Java. </p>

<p>I am also gaining real world experience with Big Data and Cloud computing platforms that are utilized in Machine Learning and Business Intelligence Analytics use cases. These use cases are especially present in various sectors of Industry where digital transformation is playing a huge role in determining business outcomes.</p>

- 🔭 I am now working on a very complex Data Migration Project on Google Cloud Platform, implementing data models and Data Warehousing designs using dbt and airflow with Google Cloud BigQuery, for a major Enterprise Banking Client in Canada. I am also building pipelines for Apache Hive lift-and-shift workloads with Python and HiveQL and shell scripting. This is high-end GCP consulting at its best!
- 🌱 I was working on Platform Configuration, Backend Development (Flask) and Telco Data Migration projects, implementing Telecom Charging Software Systems hosted on the Public Cloud (AWS)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cloud Computing and Data Migration on GCP, Productionizing Machine Learning models, building data pipelines, DevOps and infrastructure Engineering best practices, as it relates to Data and Machine Learning Engineering.
- 🌱 Previously, I was working on applying Computer Vision (Object Detection and Optical Character Recognition) models using the YOLO Object Detector and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. Models were used to extract technical information from industrial design documents and blueprints.
