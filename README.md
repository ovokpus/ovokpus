<h2 align="center"><em> I am a Senior Data & Analytics Engineer with a keen focus on Analytics workloads, AI, Machine Learning, and Cloud Development Operations. </em></h2>

<p>My professional background and experience has centered around leading code implementations within project executions, interfacing with clients in order to understand their needs and requirements, as well as advancing data pipeline architectures, which are crucial for migrating data workloads to, as well as building AI applications within the Google Cloud Platform.
</p>

<p>My contributions (from design to delivery) have enabled efficient and scalable data solutions, reducing infrastructure costs significantly. Within this dynamic environment, my proficiency in Data Engineering, AI, as well as knowledge of Machine learning Operations has been pivotal to successfully transitioning complex analytics workloads to cloud-based platforms.
</p>

<p>
As a former Mentor at Lighthouse Labs, I've imparted Data Science & Analytics expertise, guiding interns and shaping learning content for future data professionals. In keeping with the current developments in the AI space, I have gained an understanding of LLMs, Prompt Engineering, as well as have built and deployed a couple of prototype RAG applications on Google Cloud Vertex AI.
</p>

<p>I enjoy working with data, discovering valuable insights that help solve problems for businesses and other types of organizations.</p>

<p>My commitment to excellence is reflected in how I contributed(and in some cases, led) team efforts to enhance the analytical capabilities of our clients. Through collaboration, we've overcome project challenges and delivered robust data modeling solutions, leveraging our expertise in data architecture and our strategic use of dbt and BigQuery with Airflow Orchestration, migrating of Hadoop workloads from On Prem to Google Cloud Platform, as well as Databricks Workflows for continuous integration and deployment. </p>

<p>This is a sampling of the work I have been doing for the past couple of years, since I made a major career pivot into Data Science. Programming and developing solutions within the data space has become my passion and pursuit. I place a high value on personal growth and making positive contributions in a friendly team environment, and I am looking to do just that to help organizations build and develop their data strategy.</p>

- üî≠ I have been working on a very complex Data Migration Projects (lift-and-shift, refactoring and mordernization) on Google Cloud Platform, implementing data models and Data Warehousing designs using dbt and airflow with Google Cloud BigQuery, for a major Enterprise Banking Client in Canada. I have also been involved with the building of pipelines for Apache Hive lift-and-shift workloads with Python and HiveQL and shell scripting. This is high-end GCP consulting at its best!
- üå± I was working on Platform Configuration, Backend Development (Flask) and Telco Data Migration projects, implementing Telecom Charging Software Systems hosted on the Public Cloud (AWS)
- üå± I‚Äôm currently improving my cloud and Generative AI Engineering skills, working on picking up product development and prototyping skills with Product Faculty and AI Makerspace.
- üå± Previously, I was working on applying Computer Vision (Object Detection and Optical Character Recognition) models using the YOLO Object Detector and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. Models were used to extract technical information from industrial design documents and blueprints.
