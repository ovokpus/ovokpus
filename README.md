<h3 align="center"><em>I am a Data Engineer, who is passionate about the Operational aspects of Data Science and Machine Learning.</em></h3>

<p>With an Educational Background in Engineering Technology and Applied Sciences, I have been upskilling for the past couple of years in Data Science, and I have worked on a few Data Science projects, both individually and as part of a team.
</p>

<p>I enjoy working with data, discovering valuable insights that help solve problems for businesses and other types of organizations.</p>

<p>I also love programming and am enhancing my skills in Python and and SQL (for database design, modelling, development and administration). I also have marginal exposure to JavaScript, Microsoft C#(.NET Core), and a tiny bit of Java . I am also gaining real world experience with Big Data and Cloud computing platforms that are utilized in Machine Learning and Business Intelligence Analytics use cases. These use cases are especially present in various sectors of Industry where digital transformation is playing a huge role in determining business outcomes.</p>

- 🔭 I was working on a very complex Data Migration Project on Google Cloud Platform, implementing data models and Data Warehosing designs using dbt and airflow with Google Cloud BigQuery, for a major Banking Client in Canada. This is high-end GCP consulting at its best!
- 🔭 I was working on Platform Configuration, Backend Development (Flask) and Telco Data Migration projects, implementing Telecom Charging Software Systems hosted on the Public Cloud (AWS)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cloud Computing and Data Migration on GCP, Productionizing Machine Learning models, building data pipelines, and DevOps and infrastructure Engineering.
- 🌱 Previously, I was working on implementing Computer Vision (Object Detection and Optical Character Recognition) models with YOLO Object Detector and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.
