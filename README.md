<h3 align="center"><em>I am a Technical Specialist with a keen focus on Data Science and Machine Learning Development.</em></h3>

<p>With an Educational Background in Engineering Technology and Applied Sciences, I have been upskilling for the past couple of years in Data Science, and I have worked on a few Data Science projects, both individually and as part of a team.
</p>

<p>I enjoy working with data, discovering valuable insights that help solve problems for businesses and other types of organizations.</p>

<p>I also love programming and am enhancing my skills in Python, JavaScript, Microsoft C#(.NET Core), and SQL (for database design, development and administration). I also gaining real world experience with Big Data and Cloud computing platforms that are utulized in Machine Learning and Business Intelligence Analytics job roles.</p>

<p>This is a sampling of the work I have been doing for the past couple of years, since I made a major career pivot into Data Science. Programming and developing solutions within the data space has become my passion and pursuit. I place a high value on personal growth and making positive contributions in a friendly team environment, and I am looking to do just that to help organizations build and develop their data strategy.</p>
